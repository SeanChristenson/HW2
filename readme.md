So the main thing I noticed about the differences in what the ai made and what I made was spacing and keeping stuff organized. I kinda keep everything lumped together if I can because I have an easier time keeping track of it. But the ai makes notes and uses a lot of spaces. I just usuallyl rmember how far down something is but I imagine if I wanted to make something rather extensive notes would be essential. I feel like I could explain the code rather well, mostly because chat.gpt leaves notes on the coded lines explaining what each is doing. I would say the idea that comes to life due to the code is mine because I had to tell it to create it but the underlying code is not because I did not make it.

(I am not sure if you wanted me to provide what the ai created so I did not include it in the document but just let me know if you would like to see it as I'll keep it saved.)
